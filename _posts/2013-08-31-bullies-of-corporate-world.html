Actually&nbsp; if anyone would think about their past lives - schooling days, college days.....&nbsp; There&nbsp; is a prominent appearance of a unwanted person known as <b>BULLIES</b> <br />
&nbsp; Someone might have been a bully who would have acted as a roadblock. But as we move onto a corporate world then we think those hard times given by the bullies have gone. But,&nbsp; heads up&nbsp; its really sad to see the same bullies in the corporate world too. </div>
<div dir="ltr">
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you think people at higher posts&nbsp; have become meaner&nbsp; and are sunk in there pride?? </b></div>
<div dir="ltr">
Well it seems that&nbsp; these people become bully because they have been bullied in the beginning&nbsp; of their career by their seniors and later when they are in a respectable position&nbsp; they desire to bring the same wrath upon the new comers. </div>
<div dir="ltr">
Because of this unwelcoming nature of the senior workers, newbies have a hard time to blend in the office culture and also could not provide their cent percent in the task allotted to them.&nbsp; Mostly they have fear if a thing is done wrongly once then all the blame is put upon them without giving a thought to the mental stress , will he be able to bear the blame or just perish under the blame and get exposed to the sarcasm .&nbsp; People at the high post just to clear their hands of the blame they plant the blame on the immediate junior and then he does to the other&nbsp; level and so the chain of imposition of blame continues down the hierarchy. </div>
<div dir="ltr">
So it's not a person but the whole chain of bullies being followed. But If the people at good position so called bosses,&nbsp; team leads,&nbsp; group leader somebody&nbsp; takes the stand and does not bully the new comers, then he will definitely&nbsp; give space for new people who think in a progressive&nbsp; way. This will help&nbsp; in reducing the bully concept from the system. If the mangers, team leads understand the error and impose the blame on not only on the member at the lowest level but he should impose it in the team completely so that&nbsp; whole team of people are held responsible. </div>
<div dir="ltr">
Yes someone might say that what will happen if one manager or lead does that but news flash, this small stand will help the juniors or the new comers prosper and would enhance the office environment. </div>
<div dir="ltr">
So this is my view stating the problems but others might have a different opinion. I might have offended some people sorry for that, but someone needs to come forward&nbsp; for this. </div>
