Science and technology have always been leading aspect of<br />
life. It serves as the solution to the skepticism of mind. Nowadays in all the<br />
known fields’ technology and science is embedded in form of advanced equipment<br />
and modern methodologies. In present scenario even we couldn't imagine our jobs<br />
without technology, &nbsp;as all the data<br />
which were earlier kept as record in racks of registers are now been transformed<br />
in databases , even balance sheets and accounts are maintained in Microsoft<br />
Excel. So the point here I want to make is that if we can’t imagine things<br />
without science and technology how can youth be kept away from this, being one<br />
generation ahead of us. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal">

<div class="MsoNormal">
Youth are the future of the nation and for their<br />
empowerment, technological sync is must. They should be educated with the science<br />
and technology as a part of their elementary education so that by the time they<br />
grow up they have a fair understanding of technologies. It is very important<br />
that develop an inquisitive mind so that they can question the happenings and<br />
act aptly, this kind of thinking is empowered by combined role of science and technology.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">

<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;Science and<br />
Technology plays pivotal role in shaping up their life and career and this in<br />
turn will benefit our nation. As in near future youth will take over the reins<br />
of the country, by that time they should have knowledge of science and technology<br />
stocked in their arsenal so that they are ready for any kind of challenge and<br />
they could work for the advancements of the country.</div>
<div class="MsoNormal">
</div>
<p></p>
<div class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;So to conclude I<br />
would like to say that, science and technology are the sheer roots of youth,<br />
indirectly are the roots of nations’ development and advancement.</div>
</div>
