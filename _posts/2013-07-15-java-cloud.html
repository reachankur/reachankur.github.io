Hi,</p>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
I will discuss about the Java Cloud - as the name suggest it deals with something related to Java as cloud service. Actually&nbsp;Oracle Java Cloud Service provides a platform to develop and deploy business applications in the cloud. With Oracle Java Cloud Service (Java Cloud Service), businesses can maximize productivity with instant access to a cloud environment powered by Oracle WebLogic Server, complete with integrated security and database access. This section provides a brief introduction to Java Cloud Service. It explains core Java Cloud Service concepts and how to install the Java Cloud Service SDK, and offers an overview of deploying Java EE applications.</div>

Basically in a nutshell , what Oracle Java Cloud is providing is a way how you can deploy a Java application (in a WAR file format) &nbsp;and easily attach a database on the fly. This has basically great advantage for the testers of the application as they can test the application on the fly . With the subscription of &nbsp;Oracle Java Cloud you get separate instances for Java Service and DBMS service and believe with what comes bundled with this is the top-notch security of Oracle with SSO(Single Sign On) service embedded , which deals with the security.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">
One great thing about Oracle Java Cloud is that they provide a 1 month trial version which provides you all the services of the full version so that you can evaluate and carry on with the paid subscription.</div>

Along with this write up I am attaching a&nbsp;presentation&nbsp; which gives a clear perception of Cloud services .</div>
