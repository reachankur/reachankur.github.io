title: Java FX | A Powerful Platform

Today, in the age of Web 2.0,<br />
AJAX, and the iPhone, users have come to expect their applications to provide a<br />
dynamic and engaging user interface that delivers rich graphical content,<br />
audio, and video, all wrapped in GUI controls with animated cinematic-like<br />
interactions. They want their applications to be connected to the web of<br />
information and social networks available on the Internet. Developers, on the other hand, have become accustomed to tools<br />
such as AJAX/HTML5 toolkits, Flex/Flash, Google Web Toolkit, Eclipse/NetBeans<br />
RCP, and others that allow them to build and deploy rich and web-connected<br />
client applications quickly. They expect their development languages to be<br />
expressive with features that liberate them from the tyranny of verbosity and<br />
empower them with the ability to express their intents declaratively. </div>
<div class="Pa18" style="margin-bottom: 8.0pt;">
During the early days of the Web,<br />
the Java platform was the first to introduce rich content and interactivity in<br />
the browser using the applet technology (predating JavaScript and even Flash).<br />
Not too long after applets appeared, Swing was introduced as the unifying<br />
framework to create feature-rich applications for the desktop and the browser.<br />
Over the years, Swing matured into an amazingly robust GUI technology used to<br />
create rich desktop applications. However powerful Swing is, its massive API<br />
stack lacks the lightweight higher abstractions that application and content<br />
developers have been using in other development environments. Furthermore, the<br />
applet's plugin technology was (as admitted by Sun) neglected and failed in the<br />
browser-hosted rich applications against similar technologies such as Flash.</div>
<div class="Pa18" style="margin-bottom: 8.0pt;">
&nbsp;The JavaFX is Sun's (now part of Oracle)<br />
answer to the next generation of rich, web-enabled, deeply interactive<br />
applications. JavaFX is a complete platform that includes a new language,<br />
development tools, build tools, deployment tools, and new runtimes to target<br />
desktop, browser, mobile, and entertainment devices such as televisions. While<br />
JavaFX is built on the Java platform, that is where the commonalities end. The<br />
new JavaFX scripting language is designed as a lightweight, expressive, and a<br />
dynamic language to create web-connected, engaging, visually appealing, and<br />
content-rich applications. </div>
<div class="Pa18" style="margin-bottom: 8.0pt;">
The JavaFX platform will appeal<br />
to both technical designers and developers alike. Designers will find JavaFX<br />
Script to be a simple, yet expressive language, perfectly suited for the<br />
integration of graphical assets when creating visually-rich client<br />
applications. Application developers, on the other hand, will find its<br />
lightweight, dynamic type inference system, and script-like feel a productivity<br />
booster, allowing them to express GUI layout, object relationship, and powerful<br />
two-way data bindings all using a declarative and easy syntax. Since JavaFX<br />
runs on the Java Platform, developers are able to reuse existing Java libraries<br />
directly from within JavaFX, tapping into the vast community of existing Java<br />
developers, vendors, and libraries. </div>

The most fascinating thing about JavaFX is that we &nbsp;need not take pain to install any third party plugins or include any external libraries,<br />
as it comes bundled with JRE, from Java7 onwards,&nbsp;in turn&nbsp;JavaFX leverages the extreme ubiquity, power, performance and security of the JRE.&nbsp;So we just need to install<br />
Java and you are ready to build FX applications with inbuilt library with utmost ease.</div>

JavaFX provides a vivid range of functionality like animation, support for Canvas API, Multi-Touch Support and many more.JavaFX offers a dramatically shortened production cycle for designers and developers through its designerâ€“developer workflow. JavaFX allows you to incorporate multimedia assets from popular third-party design tools such as Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop using the JavaFX Production Suite.</div>

One other thing which I personally like in JavaFX is that , the FX application which is made is directly&nbsp;available&nbsp;as an executable JAR file as soon as the code is compiled , so it becomes pretty easy for distribution purposes .&nbsp;</div>

Feel free to post any queries in the the comments section I will be more than happy to answer them . I will be posting a basic FX game , FX Movie maker and FX Video player soon with the complete description of the code. So stay tuned , key in your email in 'Follow By Email' to get the notification as soon as I post .</div>
